# AI Assistant

NyaTerm includes an AI Assistant panel for command generation, terminal output explanation, error analysis, and multi-step terminal workflows.

## What It Can Do

- **Ask mode** for one-off help such as generating commands, explaining selected output, and analyzing errors
- **Agent mode** for multi-step work using an observe-decide-run loop against the active terminal session
- **Recent-output actions** so you can ask AI to explain the latest terminal output without manually copying it
- **Structured command cards** with risk levels, execution controls, and optional save-to-quick-command support
- **Approved command execution tools** for Agent workflows, with a separate final-answer step after terminal work completes
- **Inline terminal capture** during Agent execution with configurable `Terminal Output Lines`
- **Session mentions** with `@` to bring other terminal sessions into the AI context
- **Provider management** for built-in providers, manual model entries, credential groups, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Risk control** for high-impact commands, including approval gates and safer alternatives

---

<a name="what-is-nyaterm"></a>
# What is NyaTerm

**NyaTerm** is a desktop client for SSH-centric operations and mixed terminal workflows. It combines a React + Tauri interface with a Rust backend so you can manage remote hosts, local shells, file transfers, authentication, network tooling, AI-assisted terminal actions, session import/export, diagnostics, and encrypted sync/backup from one workspace.

- **NyaTerm is** an SSH client for developers, sysadmins, and DevOps engineers
- **NyaTerm is** a terminal workspace with tabs, horizontal splits, and vertical splits
- **NyaTerm is** an SFTP browser with a transfer queue and local-edit-then-upload-back workflow
- **NyaTerm supports** SSH, Local Terminal, Telnet, Serial, RDP, and VNC sessions
- **NyaTerm is not** a shell replacement; it connects to remote shells, local shells, Telnet endpoints, and serial devices

---

<a name="why-nyaterm"></a>
# Why NyaTerm

NyaTerm is built for people who move between servers, local commands, devices, and configuration files all day.

- **Workspace-first** — keep related terminals together with tabs, split panes, side panels, and child windows
- **Remote operations in context** — browse SFTP files, follow terminal paths, run transfers, and edit remote files without leaving the session
- **Security-aware workflows** — manage credentials, keys, known hosts, OTP, lock screen, and master-password protected storage
- **Portable configuration** — import from existing tools, export encrypted `.nya` backups, and sync encrypted snapshots through WebDAV or S3-compatible storage
- **AI where it is useful** — generate commands, inspect output, and run approved multi-step actions from the active terminal context

# Getting Started

## Download

Download the latest build for your platform from [nyaterm.app](https://nyaterm.app) or [Releases](https://github.com/nyakang/nyaterm/releases).

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Windows | `.msi` / `.exe` / portable `.zip` |
| macOS | `.dmg` |
| Linux | `.deb` / `.AppImage` |

For the Windows portable edition, extract the zip and run `NyaTerm.exe`. **Help → Check Updates** uses the same Cloudflare R2 update manifest and download source as the installed edition. Tauri updater signatures are always verified before staging an update; NyaTerm preserves the complete `data/` folder while replacing the program files and restarting.

### macOS

macOS users can install NyaTerm with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install nyakang/nyaterm/nyaterm
```

This uses the [`nyakang/homebrew-nyaterm`](https://github.com/nyakang/homebrew-nyaterm) tap and installs the `nyaterm` cask. You can also download the `.dmg` installer from [nyaterm.app](https://nyaterm.app) or [Releases](https://github.com/nyakang/nyaterm/releases), then drag NyaTerm into `/Applications`.

NyaTerm is currently not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. If macOS reports that the app is damaged or cannot be opened after installation, remove the quarantine attribute and open it again:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/NyaTerm.app
```

### Arch Linux / AUR

Arch Linux users can install NyaTerm from the AUR:

```bash
yay -S nyaterm-bin
```

Or with `paru`:

```bash
paru -S nyaterm-bin
```

You can also build it manually from the AUR repository:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/nyaterm-bin.git
cd nyaterm-bin
makepkg -si
```

AUR package: [`nyaterm-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nyaterm-bin)

> `nyaterm-bin` is a community-maintained binary AUR package. If the AUR package has not yet caught up with the latest release, download the official package from [Releases](https://github.com/nyakang/nyaterm/releases).


## Web / Docker Deployment

The Web Beta serves the browser interface and API from a single container for one trusted administrator. See [deploy/web/](./deploy/web/README.md) for build and Compose commands, and the [deployment guide](./docs/web-deployment.md) for configuration and supported capabilities.

## Prerequisites for Development

- Node.js 18+
- Rust stable via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- pnpm

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyakang/nyaterm.git
cd nyaterm
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```
